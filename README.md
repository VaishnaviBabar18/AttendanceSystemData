# 🎓 Face Recognition Attendance System

A real-time, AI-powered attendance system using face recognition with a Streamlit dashboard.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project includes three main components:

1. **`add_faces.py`**  
   → Captures and stores face data using OpenCV for training the model.

2. **`test.py`**  
   → Recognizes faces in real-time using KNN and marks attendance in a CSV file.  
   → Features voice feedback using `pywin32`.

3. **`app.py`**  
   → Streamlit app to display the latest attendance records dynamically.  
   → Includes a FizzBuzz counter with autorefresh functionality.
